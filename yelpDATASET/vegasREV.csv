2,l7KB334CXThAcmZPOvF1zw,Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,N6zhXHPIrCXommDEg0Rw3g,2.0,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2017-01-02 03:48:03,3,1,1

We were craving breakfast food and decided to check this place out. We shared a skillet and a few breakfast sides, each of which were cooked to perfection and super tasty. The atmosphere here is cute, clean, and just what you want for enjoying your breakfast. 

What really made our day being here was our awesome server, Tina. She was so cool, upbeat, easy to talk with, and was the most accommodating server you could ever hope to have. We plan on returning for more good eats and to see Tina again. :)",2018-04-27 18:31:23,2,0,1
4,48a4A2YXYOWrHuA5Lk-eQw,A4zLP5AyKEEHQr_dWEZKig,i8O9HI9mZZI1MRK2LrJmFA,4.0,"I was very skeptical about this spot. 
First it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the Las Vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic, Asian middle eastern, etc. If you want one, go off the strip. 

second A place that proudly serves ""Middle eastern"" and also ""Greek"" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion. 

And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good! 
The lamb shawarma was also good.
And branzino fish with labaneh was on point. 

Even though our hostess did a terrible job, our server was lovely. 

So bottom line. Worth visiting. A solid 4 stars spot.

The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. 

Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice.

I wish it could have been spicier but in the end I was contently full and very happy with my choice. $14 for the dining experience was well worth it.

13,D3vieRpv7g5o0WYQqa6VoQ,-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw,ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5.0,"My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, ""International Market? That looks interesting.""  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, ""$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!""

So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.

Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.

After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.

I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them.",2011-09-25 18:44:12,18,14,10

If you don't already know, Metro pizza serves up a pretty yum pie. I am familiar with a few of their locations, and this one did not taint the reputation. 
My favorite thing from Metro however, is not the pizza. It is their meatball sliders with fries. BOMB! Yummy meatball sheltered in a garlic knot, YAS PLEASE! They are soooo good!

This time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here's what happened....I ordered the following items:

Bean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99
Bottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19

Since I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn't have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn't say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier ""I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?""  She said ""No"" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, ""Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter"".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  

I didn't say anything to them...it would've done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.

I do have one tip to customers. I made an online order with the steak meat on the side. NEVER ORDER THE MEAT ON THE SIDE.

I'm pregnant so I can't have raw meat, but I love chipotle. I didn't want to be a pain so I figured I'd just order it on the side and cook it to well done at home.

I only got a TINY little plastic tub of meat...I asked the lady at the register,""this is the meat on the side??"" She almost looked ashamed and said,""uhh, yea..""

I'm very impressed with The Sparklings.
I waited months and months for it to open and even asked ""when are you opening"" to a construction worker once :)

It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake. 

The ambiance of the former sushi joint 
is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.

The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food. 

We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits. 

They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.

Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)

The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol. 
The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.

I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.

I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.  

I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much.

The chicken can be a bit charred or dry sometimes but it's normally not a problem. I also get the fajita veggies. However, the veggies can be a hit or miss for me. I normally like my veggies more the in the sautéed side but sometimes they can be more crunchy and raw for my taste. I love their corn salsa so I tell the person to like that stuff on my bowl. I do notice that this location does tend to give me a little smaller portion than at other locations.",2016-01-04 05:09:53,1,0,0

The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap.

Service was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt. 
Their spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked.  They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home.
Their creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving.  Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing.

If you have a big appetite this is the place for you.  If you do not have a huge appetite, I recommend splitting the meal if you come with someone else, which will lower the price significantly.  The reason why I did not give egg works a 5 star was because of the price, which unfortunately is consistent with all the other good breakfast establishments. If you don't mind taking a break from usual toast, please please please try out the banana nut muffin.  It is amazing.

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling. 

Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!

The previous day, I was sightseeing, walking through the casino, and NA caught my eye!  They have a menu outside their front doors and I observed it.  Well, I saw that they have Pho!!! I loooove Pho and it is difficult to find in my hometown area.  So right away, I knew I already wanted to come back and try it.  When I got back to my hotel, I read a few Yelp reviews and saw pictures from my fellow Yeeps Ken L and Mike O. 

I came back next day, before opening 11am Monday morning.  I got there 15 minutes early and a line was already forming!  I think I was the 4th person and by the time they opened, I am sure there were at least 30 people waiting.  I got the impression that this was a great sign and people in line were ready to get in and order lunch!!  The restaurant is very open area, lots of space, and nice decor.  I liked it very much and felt comfortable seated at my table.  There are lots of tables and I also saw a counter area. 

My server came over and took my order.  I still looked over the menu while I was waiting and there are soooo many items on there that I would love to try, but I specifically came back for the ""Pho Prime"".  OK, this is the most Expensive Pho I have ever bought at $16.95.  I normally pay 7-8$ for a bowl at other places in Nor Cal.  But that being said, I really didn't care about the price, if I want something, I buy it and plus I was on vacation in Vegas... have to Enjoy every moment to the fullest :)

The Pho Prime was Delicious.  It had a great flavor in the broth, lots of meats, lots of noodles, and I enjoyed eating it  BUT, No Hoisin sauce, it didn't come with my plate so I asked for it and my server said they ran out yesterday??  The Pho Prime is a huge bowl too, I could not finish it.  It was definitely worth the price and place!  My server was OK, and she was busy with other tables as well.  I was disappointed I couldn't order a dessert, 3 of 4 choices that I wanted to try on the menu were out!!!  At first I almost didn't believe it lol, like for real?  I really wanted to order the Hawaiian Papaya :/  so I decided not to get a dessert, changed my mind.  Then it took awhile for me to get the bill, I was waiting...

Overall, I had a very good lunch and Yes, I would definitely return!  Considering the location, how much I like the Venetian casino, and all the menu options that I read sounded tasty.  Hopefully, the next time I am in town I can come in and order a big dinner.  This is a great place for couples or groups, plenty of seating.  I left fulfilled and satisfied that I got my Pho ;)",2015-07-28 11:30:13,11,4,6

+ Country music filling up the atmosphere
+ Band on stage
+ Dim tasteful bar feel with some lighting (just incase beer goggle's not enough *nudge nudge*)

Jessica's the BEST. My entire table pretty much all ordered the free meal deal and 2 appetizers. I can understand what an annoyance it can be to have 2 handfuls of troops come in and ask for the free burger && beer deal. Poor thing had to carry out 10 plates && 10 beers knowing that the tab's only going to be $25 at most (for the 2 appetizers). Given the scenario, I honestly didn't expect her to come by and check up on us, but she did. And she was so attentive despite what 20% of $25 is (don't worry, she got waaay more than 20% of the tab).

I'd give this place 5 stars if they didn't charge so much for mediocre food. $14 for an OK tasting burger? Cmon now. I can slap together the same burger @ home for $12.50 cheaper!",2011-01-09 01:31:03,4,5,4

That being said, there is nothing worse than a lackluster plate of eggs. Oh, but I'm wrong! Couple mediocre eggs with poor service, Beach Cafe showed me all sorts of low.

Walking in, it is generally expected for you to seat yourself - after you overcome the awkwardness of glares from the bar patrons in the back. Service was generally slow, leaving us to scramble for menus and wait a few minutes before even being greeted. 

I had ordered the Cali Bene - eggs benedict with avocado, tomato, spinach with a side of home fries. One of my friends stuck to her favorite of chicken fingers (with the sole intention that the ranch was made in house). While one of my other friends, wavering with indecision, chose the Redondo Beach Egg Salad Sandwich with a side of Chicken Tortilla soup. The food came out promptly, so I'll give the Beach Cafe that. However, taste was lacking. Hollandaise sauce soaked half the plate, which normally I do not mind. However, it was so salty that I attempted to dissect the parts of my benedict that had not been attacked with sodium. After three minutes, all hope was lost - my Cali Bene was fairly inedible. The home fries were decent, better in comparison to the salt fest next to it. As for my friends' food, the chicken fingers were good (not a difficult accomplishment). My other friend quickly demolished her soup (as much as I love brunch, so has the same affinity for soup). However, her egg salad sandwich was primarily two pieces of bread with a thin layer of egg salad. I took a bite, and was unimpressed - my school's dining hall has done better. 

What really set in my apathy towards this place was the lack of cordiality demonstrated by both the staff and the longstanding patrons. After a couple had left the restaurant, one of the staff members had engaged in openly mocking and criticizing them. The heckling riled the customers she had been talking to, and soon spread like wildfire. My party felt fairly uncomfortable afterwards - both out of shock for their lack of propriety as well as the fear that our departure would result in insult. 

Honestly, mediocre at best food. Service was fairly nonexistent, at best spotty. The only thing that could remedy this was 99 cent ice cream far, far away.",2011-08-24 23:52:59,0,0,0

Decor is mostly all white with colored lights that change every so often; it also has a moving piece in the ceiling that is supposed to represent the moon with multi layers that rearrange in different shapes. It catches your eye. 

As soon as we entered we were being rushed to order as the kitchen was closing. No biggie. We ordered and set down and got our water. It was a waiting game from then on. Our waiter took 20 minutes to come to us after I got his attention for the drink menu. He brought one menu for 5 people. No worries we shared the menu then waited for another 15-20m to get someone's attention to take our drink order. Drinks came to the table at a reasonable time and were very good. I had the ""inception"" cocktail. It was delish. 

Food also came out at a reasonable time. 
Apps: chicken curry puffs $15- 10/10 curry filling was tasteful and good combination with puff pastry
Mr chow spare ribs $19- 5/10 not much flavor.
Beijing meat dumpling $15-7/10 it was a little bland but mr chow's house sauce fixed that. 

Finished our apps and No water refills. Had to get someone's attention for refills. No one checked on us if we wanted more drinks from the bar or anything either. 
Entrée: 
Steamed sea bass $45- 10/10 it's sea bass! The sauce on it was very good. 
Velvet chicken $36- 3/10 no taste at all! Had to add lots of special house sauce.
Lamb with spring onions $38- 3/10 again, no taste to it. All you can taste is the lamb and salt. House sauce helped. 
Beef with oyster sauce $42- 7/10. Oyster sauce added enough salt to make it this dish pleasant. 

Again, finished dinner, no water refills! I mean I am eating Chinese food here. Come on, you know how much salt and oil is In this food?! just refill my water when I am paying $15-20 for appetizers! And They weren't short staffed. They were OVER staffed in my opinion. Staff was just walking around aimlessly. I felt like I had to hunt someone down to get anything I wanted like simple water refills. The staff is friendly and accommodating once you get their attention just not motivated on their own. The worst part of it all was my stomach did not feel well an hour or two after dining here. And suffered the next day as well sitting on the shit pot. (It was only me that had stomach issues the other four diners did not have a problem. so it could just be me)
If it wasn't for the suffering I would have gone back to give them another chance and try other stuff on the menu.

They even put the wrong cheese (fennel pizza is supposed to have ricotta not mozzarella). I guess I just need to be more clear, but it's my 1st time here. 

Dough was thin and crispy, but the ingredients were sparse and not as nicely art directed as a Blaze pizza or Pieology. Those places seem to put more care in the assembly of your custom pizza.

1.  I asked for gluten free crust.
2. They delivered my pizza to me at my table.  I took a bite and immediately knew the texture was wrong.

HOWEVER, they handled it PERFECTLY!

First, they made sure I wasn't in imminent danger.  I'm not ALLERGIC, I'm intolerant...my stomach feels sick later, but I can still breathe and don't need an ER.  So, they did the right thing there.

Then, waiter accepted FULL responsibility.  They remade my pizza and they remade a fresh dish for my friend as well so that she didn't have to choose between eating without me or waiting and letting her dish get cold.  Good move!

Waiter was absolutely amazingly friendly and made our happy hour beverages himself (he used to be a bartender...my Mai Tai was DELICIOUS!)

They remade my pizza, with a gluten free crust, and they didn't charge me for it without me asking for them to take it off!

Basically, they messed up, but they made up for it in a big way, and I'm sure they learned a valuable lesson. I'm glad this happened to me and not someone who is deathly allergic to wheat, because that would've been a horrible experience for everyone involved.

My significant other was at this establishment for a work function. I asked him to bring me back an order, since he was having dinner there. (why cook when he already ate?) I had him order the spaghetti with meat sauce. 

I was stoked for him to arrive home. I immediately fixed a bowl full of spaghetti. I ended up eating it because I knew I needed to eat, since I skipped lunch. :( It was still hot (coming from the west side of town, to the east), but I've had better. I guess I'll have to tough it out and finish the order over the next two days. I hate wasting food, especially at that price.

The portion size was pretty generous. It came with a big portion of salad, and a bag of some bread. The bread wasn't too great, which could have been due to the time it spent out. (a little hard on the outside, and a tad too chewy on the inside. Not a great combo). 

I wonder if the pizza would have been a better choice. But for the take out order of spaghetti with meat sauce, I was not impressed. It lacked great flavour/taste. It tasted generic. 

For a small chain, I expected better. Nothing beats home made spaghetti, but when dining out, my favourite ones are from Buca di Beppo and Olive Garden.",2013-10-24 02:15:36,1,1,0

I thought that I'd never find anyone that comes close to M&M's infamous blueberry donuts.  But guess what?  Donut Hut located off Desert Inn on the east side of town has blueberry donuts that are as good as it gets.  Even better...you don't have to travel all the way to Anaheim and wait 45 minutes in line to get one.  Here at the Donut Hut, their blueberry donuts are ready, fresh, and are for real.  Their blueberry donuts are crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, which is the perfect texture for a blueberry donut.  Don't expect a plain donut with candy coated blueberry flavor here.  You get the real thing with real blueberries.  Trust me, one of the best blueberry donuts that I've ever had. I also tried their French Cruller, which is only served on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday's.  Still pretty good, but I'm still thinking about them blueberry donuts. 

My review doesn't stop here.  The owner, Sothy Seang, is dubbed the Cambodian Rambo. My gf sent me this link about Seang and fellow Yelper Nik O also posted this on Yelp Talk.

I ordered the Mushroom Chicken Noodle Soup ($13.95).  Oddly enough, no mushrooms were to be found (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA?select=T0-NanAljdtgnKdr4rwP7g).  There really wasn't much to brag about this soup.  The chicken was boneless and and the broth was a little on the bland side.  But I'm just glad that it did it's job in keeping my body hot when it was 32 degrees and snowing outside.

There's nothing really bad to say about this place though.  It's conveniently located in the middle of the Strip and the prices slightly inflated, but if you're in need of some hot noodle soup, especially during the cold winter, this is a great spot.",2011-01-09 06:35:32,3,1,2

Greasy breadsticks are served in a glass with dipping oil (we asked for balsamic) but no bread plates, so we made a mess with crumbs.  The bruschetta and market salad were good (both with no cheese).  The tomatoes on the caprese were underripe.  The steak was overpriced, but came with fat potato wedges and a small bed of spinach.

You get to create your own pizza for $7.99 w/ unlimited toppings (they have pre-created ones as well). They gave out cards for free pizza during their grand opening, so of course I had to try it.

I got the craft your own pizza & chose: Double Dough, BBQ Sauce, Italian Cheese, Ricotta Cheese, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Crispy Bacon, Mushroom, & added Fresh Spinach after it was baked.

Although their pizza was good, I honestly wish I enjoyed it more.

I can't pin point what was wrong with it. The dough was soft, meats were good, they gave ample amount of each topping, and 1 pizza could definitely be shared between 2 people. But, there was something still missing... Like as if everything was a little bland for my taste buds. Nonetheless, it was good & I'm glad I got to try it.

The atmosphere is very chill & casual, and the employees were super nice & friendly.
Like all new things, opening day can be a little rough. But despite the cons above, I'd still give them another chance & hopefully my pizza will have more flavor next time.

First of all, if you are a ramen enthusiast, then you have heard about shin sen gumi ramen from LA j-town. Shin-sen-gumi is the crown of ramen on the west coast, so to be able to go up against shin sen gumi is something to be proud off. The tonkatsu ramen soup here taste almost identical to shin sen gumi and I was blown away. Most establishments have really salty or weird flavor soup base like adding butter and garlic for a more western tongue (names I would not mention). The noodle here is the thin style but was a bit more soft compared to shin.  The owner said he could make it more chewy if I wanted to since everything is made by him including the noodles. He also said that his ramen has no added msg or preservative which is surprising to hear. I mean what? Asian food with no msg = mind blown.

Now for the con, the chashu and egg is very average. Here I feel the meat isn't marinated as much and not as sweet. The egg is bland as well like a hard boiled egg, maybe that was the intention to accentuate the flavor of the soup. The place needs more tables also. 

So why did I give 5 stars, based on the soup, noodle, and no msg, this place is on par with shin sen gumi. I support local family business and no longer need to go to la for good ramen. This will be my primary spot from now on.",2017-10-24 20:47:11,4,0,4

BBQ pork was fresh when we got it, it came out fresh in front of our eyes.  The color and the char was there. But eating it was a disappointment because the nice piece of red BBQ pork was just food coloring and nothing else. We were fooled by the looks of the item. There was no taste to it, totally bland. Only color.... 

The chicken was over marinated by salt. The meat was rough. There was no possible way for my family to eat it because it was too salty. I know my mom would hate me if I threw the chicken out, so I suggested maybe we can make porridge out of it? I don't think the chicken porridge would taste any good either. But it's in the fridge. Maybe I'll throw it out tomorrow without letting her know? 

Lastly, we had the roast duck. It actually wasn't bad. They had the duck right....  But hours later, I felt very thirsty, hinting that there was a lot of msg. It was weird cuz I haven't had msg over shock in a long time.

The express breakfast (which is the only breakfast option) is $8 or $9.  The food was horrible and greasy.  My wife was literally gagging trying to choke down her food and ended up just eating the soft, moist toast.  I'm a bigger eater than her, and even I was having trouble.  Just disgusting.

a few friends and I came in to grab a quick and delicious meal at what has always been one of my favorite little places. got in just before the rush, which is always nice.

everything was fine until we reached the condiments section of the building process. the young lady has no sense of any kind of listening skills.
My fiance asked for hot salsa, cheese and guacamole... instead he got lettuce... i don't know on what planet lettuce and guacamole sound the same but whatever, maybe its because they are the same color.... when we cried out ""no!!!'"" the young woman looked up at us, she rolled her eyes at me and said ""what?"" thats what you ordered."" I looked at her and said, ""no, he said guacamole."" and the dialogue continued...

chipotle girl- ""do you want me to take it off?""
fiance -""yes please that would be great""
CG- ""there its off"" (still a mountain of lettuce covering the majority of the burrito)
fiance - ""can you please get at least the big pieces off please? or could you maybe remake it?""

instead of removing the rest or just simply remaking the item she literally takes guacamole and covers the remaining lettuce and rolls the burrito closed.

CG - ""its fine the way it is""

Last time i check its not your call as to if its ""fine"" or not. another girl standing on the line next to her made a face to me as if to say ""oh my god i'm sorry she's crazy""

the problem associate then with a fierce attitude tossed the item into a basket and almost knocked it off of the counter.

I've literally NEVER has a worse experience from any other establishment. the manager on duty was busy so i chose not to bother her - the restaurant was beginning to fill and i didn't want to take away from anyone else's experience.

In closing I'm pretty sure mouthing off to a customer isn't in the chipotle employee handbook... our entire group was completely taken aback by the complete disregard for any kind of professionalism.

I'm a local, so I have the luxury of doing that on a slow day so I picked a Tuesday. Came in and was seated right away and thought I would get excellent service from my meh experience last time, however it was worse.

Truthfully, the food here is phenomenal! Truly. It is some of the best fine dining Western Chinese food I've had. Even the left overs are good. No dessert should be left untried. This low scoring review is strictly front of house. 

I'm over paying $500+ and tipping $100+ for a meal here in town with very blah service. I had the same uncouth waiter as last week (the one who suggested how I tip) and he acted like it was the first time in his life he's ever seen us. I get it, I used to be a server in Vegas but you should AT LEAST always remember your seven stars, especially the ones that were here with you earlier in the week. That's part of the casino/player experience. Who cares though? I don't mind he didn't remember us but I am questioning how they ring up things at this restaurant. When you order a fried rice, they charge you for two portions even though you only want one. Just make the starting price at two portions then? Stupid but I can get over that too. Ordered two baileys and decaf and they were $40 (tax included). Yes, you read that right. Apparently, you get charged $12 for each baileys and then they charge you for the coffee as well which came out in small mug so it was mostly baileys. I wonder if you order a captain and coke if you have to pay for the captain and then also the coke? We used a players comp to pay for our meal but it could be considerate if they would at least inform us if you go over. That's common sense to me even though we don't mind paying the difference. It's the little things that make your consumer feel as if you're not getting robbed. To wrap it up, we had several complaints going on in a not so busy night and the manager couldn't be bothered to come over and address our table himself. Just playing telephone with the wait staff.

I was seated right next to the big wood fire oven and OMFG the smell of like garlic and flatbreads was hypnotic.
As many of the restaurants at The SLS, plates are meant for sharing, and I thought you get a lot more than the usual tapas size. Plus, the prices here (even if it wasn't the special locals promotion) were very good- between $7-$15 for plates. 
The cocktail menu was very unique and delicious. The one I had was the clementina. It's was citrusy and spicy. It complimented my meal so well.

The food was perfection. Everything I had was kissed with roasted yummy goodness. The warm bread for my hummus - omg soooo good.

Plus- I had the greatest server ever- Jessica. She asked if there was anything I didn't like (olives) and made sure she left them out of everything I ordered.

Russel kept bringing out plates of food, some which come standard like the boiled peanuts and kimchi, and other dishes which he just offered on the house.  He brought bowls of soup, dumplings and hot tea.  Pretty soon our entire table was covered in plates and I was in heaven.  The food is simply prepared yet it all tasted awesome and was very satisfying.

The bill for all of this food, soda and hot tea was less than $20 so I gave Russell a generous tip since I think he gave us about double the food we were actually charged for.

We didn't want to travel far to get breakfast our last day at the hotel so after looking at the menu, we decided to try the restaurant at the Trump.  I know it's hard to mess up breakfast food but our breakfasts here were really great.

I ordered classic eggs benedict with country potatoes ($15) and a side of minted chopped fruit ($8).  The bf ordered the American breakfast ($14) with egg whites, toast, hashbrowns and choice of meat - in this case, spam!  

The American was quite good...egg whites were not overly greasy or buttery here & the hashbrowns were perfect - really crunchy on the outside, super soft inside.  I know that spam seems like a weird choice but we never see it on a menu so he ordered it and it was actually very well prepared here.

The eggs benedict were great!   I hate when it's drenched in hollaindaise BUT here they put it on the side - I love that!  Eggs were perfectly poached and I dipped each bite in the hollandaise - yum!  The country potatoes were thinly sliced potatoes cooked with chives and were very good.  The fruit did not have the mint taste I was hoping for but they did chop the fruit into tiny bite size pieces which I love.

It was a good breakfast but I do have one problem - I ordered a cranberry juice with ice and it cost $7!!  Usually, my restaurant rule is to just order water but I felt like a juice and I certainly paid the price for that - a small cup of juice should not cost half the price of my entree - so ridiculous!

After watching a movie at the theatres, we decided to go and indulge in some seafood (party of two). This was our second time eating here and the impression Big Sur Oyster Bar made on us the second time was just like the first; lacking customer service, fast-paced, and with no personality. I understand that this may be a high volume restaurant with majority of the people wanting to get in and out, but I believe every restaurant should have a bit of passion for customer service.  I also understand that each restaurant has its own culture, but a restaurant in a major off-the-strip hotel should have a pinch or two more. 

The food is decent. The Jambalya is soulless. The Combo Pan Roast lacks the flavor. It's sad when the best part of the meal is the table bread.

The customer service is sub-par with the servers at the bar gossiping about work drama and not even making eye contact to the customers. There was no suggestions for specials or meals, and our glasses of water were kept empty for the whole meal.  However, they were extremely quick to cash us out, which was probably a good thing.

A friend of mine from NYC (whose father is an executive with Caesars Entertainment, the parent company of Harrah's) decided to use family connections for his birthday dinner...and we all got an invitation that the dinner was to be held at Toby Keith's. Wait, what? I was confused to say the least and had to call other people who I knew were also invited before we figured out what and where Toby Keith's was.

This place reminds of my college days at the University of Arizona in Tucson: cowboy hats, country music and lots of Jack Daniels bottles used as decoration. There was live music and the main singer looked like a skinnier Toby Keith. The restaurant was loud and our waitresses handled our large (and mostly obnoxious, though in good fun) party very well.

As for the food, I ordered the ""hottie wrap"" which is a sun dried tomato tortilla filled with strips of fried chicken (I know, not part of my usual diet but with all the Jack Daniels decorations around I felt fried anything was appropriate somehow) and lots of veggies. My guilty conscience made me ask for fat free ranch instead of bleu cheese. The wrap tasted fresh and everyone enjoyed their food. Orders ranged from burgers, to wings, to mac & cheese.

I'm not going to lie, our party of 20 people had an awesome time. Everything was on the house so needless to say the drinks were flowing. I didn't partake in any of the speciality cocktails because they all come in giant mason jars. I wanted something a little daintier. Oh, and to make things interesting some man (in hindsight I pray it was the bartender) came around with a bottle and gave everyone in our party (guys and girls) shots.

Here's my story... let me start by saying I'm from the 808- exit 8 home of the best meat jun in Wahiawa Hawaii. With that said i know meat jun and know how one should taste. The meat jun here is not bad at all. Best so far on the mainland. I think the dipping sauce could've been a little better but hey it's still good. 

We arrived here around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was busy but glad they had large party tables available. We had 8 of us total. 

The server was very nice and served the table ban chan and boiled peanuts. The peanuts and cucumber kim chee was the bomb. 

In addition to my meat jun order, i had the fried saimin and kalbi. Omg, broke da mouth fo realz. The fried saimin was on point. Lots of flavor and made with fish cake. Yay!

In between all the fine dining, it's nice being able to escape from the Vegas bustle by not having to leave the Strip and cozy up to simple nostalgic home dishes.

Szechwan beef soup is a traditional favorite of mine with the broth having the right amount of spice flavor and heat. The beef is tender and the noodles are on point being chewy and soft. 

The fish filet congee is another comfort food. The fish is delicate and congee is cooked well. Personally, I wish there was more fish and this requires a couple dashes of salt, but after doing so at the table, it is perfect.

Unlike typical Chinese restaurants, traditional Chinese cooking at home doesn't drown the dish with oils, sauce, and salt which is why Noodle Asia brings such comfort to me.",2016-03-30 23:14:42,0,1,0

I didn't order any food because it was 1am or so.  I did see the clientele at this time of night, and I must say it is nothing but older rednecks. I am from Texas...but come on.  Too many old rednecks.  They have their own dancing and mating rituals which I am still not accustomed.  

The main problem with the place is the location.  It is upstairs in a cubby hole.  Difficult to find and just strange.  I do not understand who thought the location was a good idea.  I believe the decision to place the bar in this area went like this:

Harrah's Executive #1: ""So...what do we put in this isolated 'dungeon-like' place?""
Harrah's Executive #2: ""How about a redneck bar?""

I have been in the somewhat unique, albeit unenviable, position to have sampled a large variety of their lunch items. From their fish tacos to burgers to various chicken and deli sandwiches, corn chowder, and smoothies, I have yet to discover something that is at least half-decent.

Perhaps, more specifics are in order. The fried fish had a cold, thick, and dried-out texture of cardboard. The greasy burgers were overcooked and had a soggy bun. The chicken is dry, lacking in flavor, and smothered with oily cheese. The corn chowder is a nasty gelatinous goo. The smoothies are extremely sweet and not as thick as they ought to be. You get the idea...  

Why would I continue to subject myself to such awful food? One of the facilities, where I work, will order lunch for us from various places if we are working through the lunch hour. I'm not completely sure who is responsible for picking the place each time, but there must be some kind of kickbacks taking place because I cannot fathom why they seem to keep picking this place over a vastly superior alternative like Tropical Smoothie Cafe.

One time, when they asked me what I wanted to order, I told them that I would pass. However, this woman felt really bad and insisted on suggesting something that I would like. I ended up ordering some sort of chicken sandwich which was, surprise surprise, terrible. The most recent time they ordered from here, to avoid hurting anyone's feelings, I just ordered some random sandwich. I took it with me when I left the facility but dumped it in the nearest trash bin. I felt bad wasting ""food"" and for a moment thought that maybe I should give it to some homeless person.

I discovered I was gluten-intolerant this past year and it has made eating out difficult, especially when most of my favorite foods have become my worst enemies: bread,  pancakes, waffles, pasta, etc. With this current news I have been on a hunt for GLUTEN FREE items, and The Cracked Egg is a stellar winner!

The gluten free pancakes and other available options here allow me to order my favorite meals and enjoy a quality breakfast meal. The gluten free pancakes here are DELICIOUS and taste like the real deal. The omelet was very good and they even accommodate gluten free toast, which also, verrry good! Solid selection on the menu.

Well, we pay for our wristband and proceed to the bar area. We see two bartenders working. I get the feeling this isn't a good idea, and it's too late now since we bought our wristband.

The line went to the door but we didn't wait too long to order. The restaurant was very loud and was a little messy. It was difficult to find a clean table. I just figured it was due to how busy it was. 
My husband ordered the double crust so I chose the original thin crust pizza. I also ordered a side Caesar salad. The ordering process was not very organized to begin with. They took your order and wrote your name on the paper that the pizza crust was placed on. After tells the next person what you wanted on your pizza, it was ready to go in the oven and you proceed to pay. We paid, got our drinks and found a place to sit and wait.  They call out your name when your pizza comes out which adds to the loud atmosphere and on top of it they seem to struggle to read the names they have written down as many of the papers get burned while baking and erases the name. Finally, after my husband and I received both pizzas we tried it. I was so disappointed in the taste of the sauce! It tasted like canned tomato sauce and the crust was extremely thin and looked like it was precooked. My husbands pizza was kept longer because of the double crust and you could see by the burnt paper underneath that it was in the oven a while yet his cheese wasn't even melted!

The waitress forgot drinks and food all night, seemed overwhelmed and actually gave one of my guests pizzas to another table so he sat waiting for over an hour wondering where it was and finally ordered French fries to hold him over until the pizza that was coming never came, he then canceled it after he realized she had no idea where or what happened.  The food came out here and there, one salad appetizer here, someone rises meal there, and the pizzas all took the longest.  We had basically ask her over an over for things and wait a long time for everything.  She apologized but after 2 half hours we decided to skip desert we just wanted to leave.

Ordered light but sampled the roasted duck and found it flavorful and juicy.

Salt and Pepper Chicken wings I wasn't happy with the batter and the amount of salt applied.

Golden brown Vegetable egg roll with their house sauce was fried were super crispy.

Egg drop soup needs salt and frankly tasteless.

We walked up to the counter to order.  No one greeted us.  There were 5 employees standing in front of us.  One was making two burritos for himself it seems like.  They were just chatting to each other.  The guy who made our food had his hands all over counters and on his apron and pockets.  Didn't wash his hands by the way before making our food. 
 The food....brown rice was served raw, not cooked al dente... not even close.  Meat were dried and lack of seasoning.  Same goes to their expensive guacamole.  Everything was super bland the last time we came here.  

FYI, they're charging the 3 tacos differently now.  We always order 3 tacos, 2 carnitas and 1 steak with guacamole.  They charged use individually for the tacos with individual guacamole charges of .75 cents... $1.95 is the regular charge with your meal, now it's $2.25 because they charged me like this.  We eat Chipotle often, I remember guacamole around $1.25 or so.  This is ridiculous.  They should tell people to get it in the container, it's $1.95.  They should have only charged us for the $1.95 as a one time courtesy since I said something.  They're too cheap to make a regular customer happy. 

We still came here after the e. coli breakout.  That must say something, but after seeing how dirty it is here.  I don't know anymore.  I don't want to get sick.  The condiment bar is dirty and empty napkin holders and lids.  Trash cans are overflowing.

I initially went in to try one of their blueberry donuts and when I asked the owner if he had any, he said he can make it for us. At first, I hesitated because I didnt want to have him make an entire batch when I only wanted one. However, since I really wanted it to try it, I told him I can wait.
After about ten minutes, he told me the blueberry donut was ready. Although initially I came in for only one donut, I decided to buy four since I felt bad that he made it for me. After I paid $3.60 (each donut was $0.90), he apologized for the wait and decided to throw in TEN donut holes! A few would've been nice, but seriously, TEN donut holes? 
So, for $3.60, I walked out with 4 donuts and ten donut holes. The blueberry donut is extremely moist and dense (like cake), its definitely a must try.

Noodle Asia has always hit the spot when I'm in Las Vegas and craving Chinese food.  I only wish they would open a tad bit later to let me wander in drunk fulfilling the craving for a hot bowl of won ton noodle soup.  For those thinking the high review is because of eating under influence that is not true.  I've been here drunk, sober, and hung over and all three circumstances Asia Noodle has always been good to me.  I even try to stay inside the Venetian or Palazzo just so I don't have to go outside and face the elements to get to my beloved Asia Noodle.

Won Ton Noodle Soup (with and without BBQ pork), Night Market Fried Rice, Hot and Sour Soup, and the BBQ Combination Plate are my standard fare here.

We wanted to experience the new place as soon as possible, so we secured a reservation at opening time, 5:30 PM Sunday, 8/24. Our waiter was awesome: funny, without being too fake-chummy or cloying. He took a few minutes to explain the menu and sold us immediately on Lebaneh with Feta, a very creamy, almost cream-cheesy dip with wood-fired bread seasoned with garlic and zatar. Addictive, sour, spicy - everything wonderful to start the meal!

I ordered fried brussel sprouts hearts with piquillo peppers, hazlenuts, and preserved lemon as a second starter. What a wonderful explosion of tart, garclicky, salty flavors. I already love brussels sprouts, but this was heaven! My partner ordered dolmades (grape leaves stuffed wtih lemony rice and lamb). The waiter accidentally delivered 2 orders, and comped the extra one. Already starting to see that one of the ""Ss"" in SLS certainly must stand for servicel!

My partner ordered a chicken tagine, redolent of aromatic cinnamon, preserved lemon, pichouline olives, and chicken thighs. I ordered a meatball tagine with charred tomato/piquillo pepper sauce and a soft egg in the middle. So wonderful: rich and decadent. I have a picture of it that I would like to include with this review, but it's my first time posting on Yelp! (this meal most definitely inspired me), so I apologize profusely if I can't figure out how to upload pics!

By the time we were finished with our main meal, we were both far too stuffed to have anything else, but our wonderful waiter talked us into a dessert to share: molten chocolate flourless cake with vanilla bean gelato and super-ripe banana. What a wonderful, light desert! Best part of the evening came after we waited for what seemed like quite awhile to receive the cake. Eventually, the house manager came to our table, apologize about the wait for the cake, explained that ours had already been prepared, but the kitchen wasn't happy with the quailty of the result, so they cooked us a new one. The manager offered to comp something else while we waited. I had a divine Turkish coffee served in a wonderful little copper pot. Also while we were waiting, our waiter comped us with a little appetizer-sized desert (toffee chocolate bar).

Do yourself a favor and go. This was by far the best meal we've had in Vegas - anywhere (and we've bowed at the altars of Honey Salt and Lotus of Siam)!",2014-08-25 02:54:43,0,0,0

Living in SF all my life and being such a close proximity to a variety of Asian restaurants made me forgot that people in other areas aren't that fortunate. I've come to the conclusion that there is no good AUTHENTIC Asian food on the strip...even if the people cooking it ARE Asian! Ya, GO FIGURE! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE all types of cuisines, but after countless nights of drinking, the best hangover cure is jook, noodle soup, or any type of carbs for that matter! 

After the most wildest drunken night at XS, all we wanted was ASIAN comfort food without having to trek outta of the strip. We came across Noodle Asia in the Venetian/Palazzo Directory; it had ""Noodles"" in it's title, so it was a go!

Normally, you get free tea with your meal at Asian restaurants, but Noodles Asia charges $3.50. It's Vegas afterall, so I digress.

We started with the Jellyfish Salad ($10.95). What we got was a a glob of red-colored jelly fish on a 4-inch diameter plate. The jellyfish had a weird texture...actually it had no texture at all. It tasted like it had been marinating in a bag of chili oil. You know, one of those jellyfish packets you get at an Asian Market for 99 cents?

I ordered the ""Beef Noodles"" which was technically Beef Chow Fun ($12.95).  Ok, why not just call it that? It was very meh, the noodles  looked mushed together b/c they were over-cooked. And, I thought chow fun was suppose to be flat-WIDE noodles? Ummm, at least they were generous with the beef....

Service: Ahhhh, even though you're paying 2-3x more for the food here, the service NO different than any other hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant. As in, you just get your food fast and then get ignored.

I've been to many different Ramen places before but this is by far my favorite Ramen restaurant because of the clean broth here. As recommended by the chef, I order Shio Ramen with extra menma and Chashu. I really like their clean broth as I don't like thick Ramen broth.  They have complementary ginger unlike most of Ramen restaurants who would charge customers for gingers. (One other Ramen restaurant charged me $0.50 for ginger without even asking me and it was on the bill. Really?) I love spicy food so it was great to have spicy paste condiment that I could add as much as I wanted. Staffs were very attentive and friendly.

My fiance and I decided to check this place out on Sunday night to celebrate our recent engagement. We walked up to the host stand and had to greet the woman behind the desk before she acknowledged us. She asked how many and our first and last name. I asked her if there was a wait and she said no but proceeded to make us stand there awkwardly for over 5 minutes until another hostess could come seat us. I proceeded to tell the hostess we were celebrating our engagement but she must not have cared that much because she sat us in a row of 2 tops in between a single woman and two older women. Needless to say that put a damper on the rest of our dining experience. There were booths and other more intimate tables available all over and so I asked to move to one of the booths and she went and approved it with the front and then came back and moved us. We were not greeted for over five minutes, and then waited over ten minutes just for water! Once our waiter came back with the water we ordered a few drinks and put in an order for some hummus in hopes that it would come out quickly as we were starving. Another ten minutes go by before we received our cocktails. When he came back to drop them off, we told him we wanted to put in an order for our meal and he said he would be right back, this time another 5 minutes go by so with my calculations over twenty-five minutes have gone by with no food. We finally get the rest of our tapas ordered and after another five minutes we received a salad we ordered as part of our meal. Still no hummus, which we saw others around us receiving. Upon delivery of our salad we asked the server who delivered it if she could check on our hummus. Our original server stops by a few moments later and realizes he forgot to ring it in. It was delivered a few minutes later with some apologies. After the initial thirty minutes of our bad service, he seemed to be more involved. I don't know if the guy was panicking with the thought of us complaining but we felt like what was supposed to be a romantic night of celebration for us was ruined by absent minded staff and terribly slow service for a tapas restaurant. We did have some amazing cocktails including the Old Hollywood and the Honey Citrus Sidecar. The hummus with tahini and the bread served with it was warm, toasty and we craved having a second helping. We also ordered the grilled halloumi salad, which was mildly dressed with sweet vinaigrette and the salty fried cheese served with it paired beautifully. The house pickles were a fun snack, the meatball tagine were incredibly moist, had a nice smokey flavor too them and the sauce dipped perfectly into that toasty bread. The vegetable beignet were a good mix of different fried veggies served with a dill tahini sauce, the fig and almond panacotta was light, creamy and the real vanilla bean in it was the perfect finish to our meal. My fiance also had a Turkish coffee which he enjoyed. I wish I could give this place a higher rating as the food was very very flavorful and we loved that we were able to try several different dishes without walking away feeling uncomfortably full. The restaurant itself was stylish, had a great open kitchen floor plan and looked like a great place to have a fun dinner party or an intimate date. However, the delay of good service was disappointing and it would have shown us he realized he had made a mistake if he had asked a manager to take the hummus off of our bill, which did not happen.",2014-09-10 14:58:02,1,1,0

The hostess is the reason why I gave this place a 4 star, there were probably 4 tables taken in the restaurant and she sat us right by the entrance in a small table. When we asked for a table towards the back for more privacy she gave us the unwilling look, and the other employee saw her and gave her that same face back like ""they are one of those customers type of looks"". 

The server recommended about 4-5 dishes to share for two people. 

We got the babaganoush with the pita bread, calamari and Brussel sprouts to start. The pita bread is fresh out of oven very soft and chewy, definitely one of the best pita breads I have had. 
 The calamari was delicious too, the sauce goes great with the calamari. 
It is a must try. Brussel sprouts is my favorite food already, the way they fried the sprouts really brought out the flavor and the texture of it. 
The second round we got the moussakah,  wagyu beef and chicken kabob, the chicken kabob was ok, but the beef one was very tender and juicy. 
If I had to pick a favorite it would be the sprouts and least favorite would be the moussakah, it was baked and tasted very creamy. 

The dessert was fig and almond panacotta. The figs we got were dried figs, weren't  fresh like shown in some of the pictures on here, but the panacotta itself was delicious.

It was a never-ending Dionysian/Bacchanalian feast that has yet to be matched.  Oh, those were the Elite days!

But this visit was strictly for dinner, and with a $30 birthday comp in hand, we bravely set out for the restaurant after a great comedy show at the Smith Center.

We didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant wasn't crowded, so we were seated right away at a large table.  I wasn't blown away by the wine list, so I ordered a Mediterranean Margarita - tequila with fig puree and lime.  It was heavy on the tequila, so I had to ask for more of the fig stuff to moderate the alcohol.  Probably a problem only for me :)

We shared a Harisa soup, which the kitchen put into two bowls, so we didn't have to keep passing the bowl back and forth.  I loved it:  just the right amount of spice, lots of chickpeas and other veggies in a thin tomato-based broth.  

An order of falafel followed - 7 balls on dollops of hummus, with a small center mound of a couscous/tabbouleh combo.  The falafel were delicious, but slightly dry, so they could have benefited from a little more hummus.  What I don't get is that if all these small plates are meant to be shared, why have an uneven number?  You can't divide 7 by anything!!

For our main courses, my husband had chicken tagine and I ordered lamb tagine.  Our waitress said they were the largest of all the main dishes, but they really were quite small.  Enough for me, of course, especially after the soup and two falafel (along with a helping of the delicious bread that we had to ask for).  Hubby didn't expect dark meat and a bone to deal with, but he forgot to ask.  He liked it, but didn't love it.  My lamb was a bit fatty and light on the apricots, but with the generous portion of fluffy couscous, it was a good dish nonetheless.

Very good service and a delightful atmosphere, but the Strip prices don't make for a great deal without that birthday comp.  Still, a nice place to go for a special dinner.",2017-04-30 09:06:24,5,2,6

He wanted us to move to a table nearby but we waited on the hostess to tell us where to go since we didn't wanna mess up any seating arrangement with the other people waiting.  He seemed mad we moved and we even saw him talking to our new server Natalia about us and shaking his head.

She couldn't figure out why I was standing there. I told her it would be nice if I had cups to get my coffee. Keep in mind it had been literally less than a minute since she took my order. Got the cups, got coffee... Sadly it was lukewarm at best. We have ordered in many of the Einstein bagel locations over the years and know how long it takes to get the food out. This place was not busy.... And the food took about 10 minutes to come out. They got the blueberry cream cheese bagels wrong and used regular cream cheese. OK I'm a bit upset now. I go back to the counter and tell them my order is wrong. Another customer with an incorrect order was near me and saw that I was up there for the same reason as her and as we made eye contact, she muttered to me ""good luck with getting that fixed. Clearly she was upset at her order being screwed up too. Anyway... They take it back and say they are very backlogged with orders at the moment. I get the replacement bagels about 5 minutes later.

As far as the food goes, it was decent. Their kalbi and teriyaki chicken are worth getting. I disliked their spam musubi ($2/roll) because I could make better tasting ones at home.

Imagine a fusion of Polynesian-spam-based lunchroom, Korean kim chee joint and basic Chinese restaurant. Usually, when we hear ""Korean,"" it's some sort of Asian BBQ joint. Not this place.
Upon sitting down, you will get a number of different pickle-type appetizers. We got two types of kim chee, kelp noodle in a mayonnaise sauce that was quite new and tasty, boiled peanuts, and bean sprouts in brine.
We ordered the pan-fried dim sum and it was adequate.
We ordered the fried chili shrimp and the meat-and-seafood stir fry. 
The waiter warned us that the stir fry was the real deal, with sea cucumbers (sort of a cross between mushrooms and squid, but slimy). And indeed it had sea cucumbers, but nice enoki mushrooms too. I'm honestly not a huge fan of sea cucumbers but as the wait dude promised, they help make a nice gravy.
Both dishes had a mix of fresh vegetables and that staple of Polynesian/Chinese lunchrooms, mixed frozen vegetables of cut string beans, corn, cubed carrot and peas. I put that mix in canned chicken noodle soup to increase the nutrition content, but otherwise don't see much advantage to adding frozen mixed vegetables to real food.

Service was like they were either ignoring us or being chased by something with the speed they came to the table and then took off again.  Where they lost all kinds of stars was with my coffee.  I told them decaf - several times - but when they gave me my cup and I tasted it it was not decaf.  I can tell the difference; I have to know the difference.

So when we finally got someone to come back to our table we said this wasn't decaf give us decaf.  Guy comes back with a carafe that was NOT marked decaf.

FOOD (4/5):
- Chicken Noodle Soup: Organic chicken with soup, goji and noodles-- can't go too wrong. The broth was clear, hot and very qing. The chicken wasn't very flavorful, but that's what I expected from this type of soup.  We asked for extra noodles, which was an additional $3.  ($13 + $3 for extra noodles)
- Beef Noodle Soup:  Very good!  Definitely the best part of the meal was eating a hot bowl of beef noodle soup filled with steamy broth, niu rou and the tendon.  It was cooked very well and the noodles were cooked al dente. I think they gave some of the sour veggies on top, which was yummy as well.  ($13)
- Pho:  I didn't try it, but the price was a whopping $15-17! (I forget the exact price.)

SERVICE (3/5):  I'm a little surprised that Noodle Asia had a hostess who didn't know a lick of English. She had asked us to clear some space in the front and she said, ""Back to go.""  We didn't understand what she wanted and she seemed very flustered and angry (at herself?).  When a few people came to the front to ask how long the wait was, she didn't seem like she wanted to answer because they had asked in English.  The service in the restaurant wasn't too great either-- it was exactly what I had expected from a Chinese restaurant. However, since we were paying an arm and a leg for something that typically costs $6-8 in California, and since we were in Las Vegas, I was expecting better service.  At least some refill on tea and water... but we didn't get any of that type of service, and we got the same ""rushed, stony-faced, no 'thank you'"" service that we got at Sam Woo (in Chinatown). Haha.  I would still come back though. The venue and service are nothing to write home about, but the beef noodle soup definitely hit the spot for me.

WAIT:  We wanted for about 20 minutes and there were about 7 parties ahead of us. The good thing is that the line moved decently fast-- people get their noodles and dishes quickly, chomp it down, and then leave for more Vegas fun.  When I called at 12 pm, the person who picked up the phone said the wait was 1 hour.  O_O

Loved it and the drizzle of pesto sauce made the dish look even more appetizing. For my main entree I had the jambalaya, something I've never had before. It was pretty good, but I was expecting a little bit more spice and flavor to it. To me it just tasted like chicken, seafood and tomato paste mixed with white rice.  I think it was definitely missing something but I can't exactly put my finger on since it was my first time having it. I think maybe it needed a garnish of scallions on top and the dish itself could of used more garlic? It was only $13 which is very reasonable for me because it was the perfect portion size. All the prices here are very affordable, the most expensive thing is the filet mignon at $25, which I consider almost robbery. My friend had the beat salad which he enjoyed very much. We shared the cheesecake as our dessert, this was totally store bought cheesecake and the server even admitted it not being made on site.

410,RDIrip-Dhu5hrOARZ6fdeg,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,3KtmKS4624Mv5xy_9hGIAw,2.0,"Honestly, I'm very surprised at how disappointing my experience was. We showed up around 6 on a weeknight and the place was pretty empty. Strangely, we weren't greeted by anyone when we came in, and we weren't sure if that meant we were supposed to wait or seat ourselves, so we waited and felt awkward about it. After about a minute and a half, one of the servers came out and noticed us standing there so he refilled someone's water and then showed us to our table.

The service was fine, no real complaints there. We ordered the Grapes, Arugula, and Ricotta Flatbread for the appetizer. For the entrees we ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy and the Chicken Parmigiana. The flatbread had great flavors, but it was seriously unwieldy. I admit that I can, at times, be coordinationally-challenged... but in my defense this was a piece of flatbread that had grapes and candied walnuts sitting on it, with no sharp knife to cut it into pieces. We ended up with a lot of sticky balsamic glaze on our hands, and I personally got a couple of grapes and walnuts in my lap and on the floor. So that was fun. 

Her Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich was good. Though in my opinion the small garnish salad on the side was a little measly looking. My Chicken Parmigiana was kind of crazy. The chicken itself was this massive flattened piece of chicken that covered almost the entire plate. I have never seen a piece of chicken like this, I wish I had taken a picture. Anyway, it was breaded and fried, and then set on top of a pile of watery, bland spaghetti. And I mean watery as in, when I tipped the bowl, about a quarter cup of water came forth. That was the water that hadn't already absorbed into the bottom of the chicken breading. It was soggy and strange and disappointing. The flavor of the chicken and breading was good, but I couldn't get over the sog factor. The pasta was unappetizing and I couldn't really eat much of it. 

The cocktails were nothing to write home about, especially for the price. I got something with ""fresh"" blueberries in it... and dared to eat one of them. It had no flavor, other than the taste of (possibly) freezer burn.. and the mealy texture that fruit sometimes gets. It was very gross.

The last thing I feel like mentioning just for the sake of being a complainer is that they were playing a collection of popular songs covered by someone on piano/violin. This included Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses, and Unforgiven (I think?) by Metallica. Though there were no vocals in the recording, that didn't stop the guy at the table next to us from rocking out with his best Axl Rose impression. It made for an interesting ambiance, but it wasn't quite my cup o' tea.

Bottom line, I won't be back, and I won't be recommending it to anyone. I'm not much of a Yelp reviewer but this place has such amazing ratings I was left feeling confused by my experience and thought I should chime in.",2014-11-13 23:54:06,3,2,0

Had come here with an open mind and left disgruntled and frustrated.

First off, the waitress was very sassy and aggressive in tone. Had asked her about some of the items on the menu and she answered in a tone that suggested that I should already know!!! I do not work here so it would be very nice of you, as the waitress, to help me understand. Additionally, my lady had asked about getting some steamed rice and this waitress acted liked she had asked for her soul! IS IT REALLY A BIG DEAL TO ASK FOR A 2 SIDES OF RICE!!! REALLY!!! This waitress clearly needed some time off of work or something because she was dropping the ball for her team and this business!!!

Secondly, the eating utensils were not clean at all! Ewww, do you really expect me to use these dirty utensils to eat my food with! I am not a fan of bacteria and to think that it was appropriate to put these out on the table is just foolish! Luckily, I know how to use chopsticks but this is just not okay at all. I felt bad for the all the other customers that did not inspect there silverware! 

The food was alright! I was just more let down but to fact that I had such an awful waitress. 

Side note, I had some family friends come out to Vegas while I was there and they also ate at this same restaurant and had the same sentiments. They had bad customer service as well and had issues with their order as well. 

I would like to give this place another chance but this disaster that took place while I was here needs to be addressed at some point.

 THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! HUGE PORTIONS TOO! THAT was a surprise. We both saved one half for lunch he next day. Gentleman came and asks how our food was while we were eating.

There is plenty of comfortable seating, clean bathroom facilities, great food, and excellent service.

After about 2mins of standing there, i finally came up to her while she was still cleaning a table and ask, she was like ""for here to go?""

Her smile was very welcoming so I forgot about the earlier incident. A minute later an old man came up and brought my water, convincing me to try their iced tea instead. But no thank you, im good with iced water. He was very friendly and the whole time i was there, he kept checking on me, but never refilled my water. As for food, food is ok. A little pricey. I ate by myself but i felt like I paid for two. I had the combo which has kalbi, meat jun, and chicken that comes with white rice and mac.. Banchan doesnt have my fish cakes! Huhu. Banchan only consists of kimchi, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. I was so sad. I want my fish cake and tofu! lol. I didnt finish all the meat jun and chicken so i asked for a to go box.

Sothy Seang, the owner of Donut Hut on the east side of town, is living the American dream.  An immigrant who came to America in search of a better life, like millions of others have done before him, Mr. Seang's story is a fascinating one that has been documented in a recent feature by vegasinc.com (thanks for the tip, Nik O.): http://www.vegasinc.com/business/2013/dec/06/donut-rambo-cambodian-refugee-finds-success-friend/?_ga=1.243919811.754996307.1382033796
A bookmark for a while now as I aim to visit every donut shop in Vegas, the boyfriend and I paid a visit to the hut on a recent Saturday night around 8:30pm.  The Cambodian Rambo was there behind the counter and we greeted him like a long lost friend; after all, we had the advantage of knowing his life story from the article.  The shop is decorated with pictures of Mr. Seang with local law enforcement, his biggest fans, and rightly so, with his donuts and patriotism winning them over years ago. A friendly and humble man, we congratulated him on the feature article and he asked us how to find the story on his smartphone since he was still trying to figure out how to use it.  In exchange, he served up some of his delicious donuts.  I went with my usual crumb and coconut cake donuts, while the b/f had a blueberry donut and a French cruller.  I sampled his blueberry donut, which was still warm, and if that wasn't the best blueberry donut ever!  I don't normally have that flavor, but Donut Hut's version has won my heart, or stomach.  Actually, I'd have to say both.  It's difficult to come away from meeting the man behind the donuts, knowing how he survived the horrors of Pol Pot's regime, fought in the resistance, lived in a refugee camp, made his way to Las Vegas, and ultimately took ownership of this little donut shop and not feel like his donuts are something special.  It's just my opinion, but I will gladly return here to buy more donuts from a man like this and support his business with pleasure, as I try to do with other local donut shops similarly run by Asian immigrants such as Mr. Seang who probably have fascinating stories to tell, as well.  The donuts are great, but Mr. Seang is amazing.  I would encourage anyone who likes donuts to stop by and give Donut Hut a try and meet its fabulous owner.

PS:  Both the crumb donut and coconut cake donut were delicious, as well.

We ordered Lobster bisque, which came with onion crisps and a dollop sour cream, which honestly i think the lobster bisque was fine by itself and didnt need all those extras. My favorite part about the calamari was the marinara sauce. Truffle fries were great but i did think the garlic chunks were kind of big. I couldn't get enough of the Clam Linguini with a light cream sauce, that was definitely my favorite dish.

Maybe I ate here at the wrong time, totally sober, and fresh off of the airplane.  My hunger was satisfied, and I must have liked it to a degree, as my plate was pretty much clean, but reflecting back on it, my experience was simply, ok.  

There was a total of 6 guys that I went with, and we each got different things, so I was able to sample a couple of things other than what I'd ordered.  Shanghai Noodles was my choice.  It's a dish of wok-fried noodles with napa cabbage and pork.  The plate looked and smelled good, but the noodles were truly too oily.  I honestly couldn't help but think of Michael Jackson's 1980's jheri curl, so I suppose I can say that the noodles were straight up greasy.  However, one of the guys at my table got beef congee.  It had that nice thick porridgey texture that I love, not watery, as I've experienced at too many other establishments.  Also, the beef was tender, which I previously thought was impossible in a soup.  

Though the noodles, their flagship product, aren't my favorite, I can say that they had excellent service.   We were seated immediately, and almost as soon as we sat down, water was at our place settings.  Additionally, time between placing our order, and when the first dish was delivered, was relatively quick, and when it arrived to the table, it was piping hot.

The weather was fantastic, it was a great night to dine al fresco.  They have ala carte ordering, but most people order a tasting menu.  This is what we did, there were four of us and for our mains we went with the crispy duck, ma mignon, whitefish, and lamb shank.  For our appetizers, we had the prawn toast, dragon shanghai dumplings, and Mr. Chow noodles.

The wine list is decent enough and you'll probably find something that's up your alley, but I would say it's on the lower end of the spectrum for a Strip restaurant.

Of the appetizers, my favorite was the prawn toast.  Crispy and prepared perfectly, it was probably the favorite of the table.  The dumplings were next, they had some fantastic broth and pork.  I wish we had ordered more of these, I think they came 8 or 9 to an order.  The Mr. Chow noodles were likewise strong, but didn't do as much for me as the toast and dumplings.

Of the entrees, the duck was the runaway winner.  As many other Yelpers note, it had fantastic crispy skin and was tender and moist.  I'd have to give it some thought, but probably a top 3 or 4 duck I've ever had.  The entire table loved it, we probably could have finished off another one had they brought it to us.

The drunken fish was poached in wine.  It was very moist, not close to being overcooked.  The seasoning was subtle, but there.  It was probably my least favorite, but again, it was a strong dish.  My second favorite entree was the ma mignon.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, this was a very tender steak and I loved the sauce.  Were I to return I would definitely re-order the duck and steak.

The lamb is served on the bone and, like the duck, was moist and seasoned very well.

I have had better Chinese meals (Jasmine at Bellagio for example), but this was a very strong meal in a great atmosphere.  Service was fantastic too.  I would say the food is probably 4 stars but the ambiance, evening, and overall experience bumps it up to 5 stars.  Give this place a shot and ask to sit on the patio.",2017-05-13 17:39:26,3,0,3

However, I do have to say it has been about six months since I have actually sat down to dine there. When we have in the past, the hostess was always very cordial. As for the servers, it usually averages out each time I had gone - ignored this time, really good service the next time. Most of the time I order the Hong Kong pan fried noodles, some bbq pork or if I am with my mom also some roast pork. Most of the time we also get sauteed Chinese broccoli (yes, I do broccoli if it is of the Chinese variety.) Everything is usually very delicious, very flavorful and not ""Americanized"" at all. 

Lately, I find that I mostly go here during lunch time to order from their take away counter. It is always their bbq pork and rice. The old man behind the counter is pretty friendly and the young lady who rings up my order is pretty nice as well. For me it's a carnivores delight.

First I have to say that TISH is the BEST!!!  She is a wonderful waitress, attentive, funny, helpful - she certainly should be working somewhere else.  She is way over qualified and too professional for this place!

We liked the pizza when it first opened and therefore kept coming back.  But in the last 3 months it has just gotten to be terrible... portion sizes have gotten smaller... food quality is virtually non-existent and the only thing consistent about this place is that it is inconsistent.  Our bread came to the table raw inside... all 4 loaves... I mean, come on people, this is a pizza place with a bakery next door.  You should know how to cook bread!  French fries were soggy. And the pizza - barely edible.  Now, I have to tell you, we order NY thin crust cheese pizza.  If you load your pizza with a bunch of meat/veggies, you probably won't notice a change.  But we did... sauce was tasteless!  I had to request garlic and oregano and still it tasted like dishwater on bread.  The response?  Well, it must be a new cook. Hmmm.... bad answer from the kitchen.  Manager never bothered to come over to the table to address the issue.  Next day - two people in our party had the gurgly stomachs, etc....

It's too bad - the place has a nice feel - well decorated and good location.  But that doesn't make up at all for the lousy food and lack of concern from the owner/manager.  Restaurants don't run themselves....  

Fortunately they aren't the only place in town - in a city this big with the vast array of options the owners should care.  But it's evident they do not.  Just like a former reviewer said, they change things and do not notify people and they just don't care about their customers.

I usually don't publish bad reviews, as I feel it's pretty unfair for the restaurant and that maybe it just didn't match or I wasn't in a good mood in this particular moment. So I decided to sleep on it and unfortunately my frustration is still here.
Me and my friend were pretty excited about going to Mr Chow. I love Chinese street food and I've been hearing about Mr Chow for so long!
The lobby and the dining room are very nice. The giant moving centerpiece on the ceiling is quite impressive and... sensual to me. Hehe
But that's it for the good points.
Then comes the rest of it:
The first thing I noticed was the noise. This place is so loud that it completely breaks the charm and the first impression I had about the design.
The staff... OK, I get it, let's do Chinese street food in a Brasserie style. Tuxedos, white bow ties and white gloves for everybody. But again, it doesn't match the setting or the food.
Despite the place being overpacked with staff members, it took them about 10 minutes to bring us the food menu. And here comes trouble. This menu is incomprehensible. Even for our server. He couldn't explain how it was working, between the semi-prix fixe menus and the a la carte items. 
We ordered some Mr Chow Noodles as an appetizer to share, since they told us everything is served family-style. Well, it must be quite a hungry family! $20 for a super tiny portion of homemade noodles with ground meat... Really?
My friend ordered the crispy beef, I went for the player's crispy duck. Both were around $45 each. He had a mini tiny plate of tiny fried beef strips, when my duck was too big for one. The ratio doesn't make any sense for the same price...
We decided to share a side of brown rice for $8.50 and they brought us a huge casserole of rice we couldn't even eat half of it.
So the pricing makes no sense at all.
Then the General Manager visited us. Very nice guy, super attentive. He told us we should have ordered something different since there were way better items on the menu. I was like, dude! First of, why don't you say that to your customers BEFORE they start ordering, and then why do you keep offering these items if they don't match your own criteria?!
The food was very average. The crispy duck was... crispy, but dry and pretty tasteless. 
Our check was over $150 for two - and it took them more than 20 minutes to bring it up and then run my credit card.
Go to Chinatown, people. Get off the Strip. There are so many options where you can get the real Chinese street food experience for a 10th of the price and way more tasty food!!

But I don't think the other reviews adequately emphasized the absolute surreal kookiness of the place.  Imagine this: 3am, seedy strip mall on east side of Vegas, you want a donut so you ring the buzzer (for after-hours security).  Inside, it's all about dingy linoleum, molded plastic chairs and styrofoam dinnerware.  The wood paneling on the walls is barely visible due to the dozens of oversized photos of Sote (the owner) in various patriotic bad-ass soldier-of-fortune get-ups, posing with police, servicemen and other Real American Heroes (TM).  Come to find out, he was a freedom fighter from Cambodia, and now takes his U.S. pride to the xxxtreme!  I get the distinct impression that if some half-witted no-goodnik even TRIED robbing Sote's humble establishment, Sote would go completely apeshit kamikaze on his ass!  And that would be an awesome sight to behold.
n.b. The donuts are good, but pretty much standard fare for a decent donut shop in my opinion.  It's all about the atmo here!!",2010-01-11 07:49:34,4,5,3

Today was not like the other times, I waited 20 minutes when I decided to go inside to see what was going on. When I got in the lady behind the counter that seemed to be the manager asked if she could help, I explained what had happened which seemed to upset her. She went over to the register and said there were no online orders and began to help other customers, no explanation or assistance. When I pressed her about what can be done she called over another employee and she and the other employee looked at the register again and told me that there was no order. I then pressed her and showed her my email confirmation and that my card had already been charged which did not seem to change the poor attitude of any employee. 
After about 5 minutes of no help I said that my card had been charged and that I would need the order I had paid for, the manager just walked away and another employee stated that she tried ordering via the app and that it showed her card got charged but it didn't show up on the register and there must be an issue with the app and she wasn't really charged. I again showed them my email receipt and the chase app showing that my card indeed was charged. They eventually stated that I would have to contact my credit card company, to which I said that I wanted my order. They grudgingly gave me my order and I left. Even proving through multiple sources that I had indeed placed an order and paid for the lunch I barely got my food. After this experience I will not be going back, the customer service is horrendous.

Our ""go-to"" places so she sticks to Lean meats with veggies include Greens & Proteins, Jason's Deli ( salad Bar ) Terriyaki Boy or similar and  any breakfast place that serves veggie egg white omelets with a side a fruit.  Lately, her fav place is Pei Wei.  Surprisingly, I've come to enjoy Pei Wei, too.

Her standard dish is Chicken Curry ( sauce on the side ) , ""stock velvet"" with extra veggies, no onion and brown rice ( 7.95) - It's a very large serving for the price.

I usually get a bowl of hot and sour soup ( $4.95) - a little too ""thick "" from what i presume is corn starch but i like it and it's a very generous serving.  I then prefer the dan dan noodles with Shrimp ($8.50) - I've yet to finish it given the large portion provided.  Again, for what it is, I'm a fan.  Yes, it's ""americanized"" but i don't care.  It's freshly prepared, served fast, large portions, reasonably priced and above average taste.

566,fjQtpSSAaq-zq_iYLkTxfg,k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,4.0,"What I miss about my New York heritage is the food that I grew up with. Especially the egg plant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. Metro Pizza has reunited me with the eggplant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. The majority of the time that I dine in Metro Pizza this is what I order.

   This location is the newest Metro Pizza to open in  Las Vegas. Ever since we drove back from the Spring Mountains this previous summer, I have been anticipating the opening of the restaurant.

   In a way, this Metro Pizza is roadside architecture. It stands at the northeast corner of US 95 and the 215, where the spaghetti bowl of the northwest valley will probably be built. At the time that I write this, the motorist has to maneuver through a maze of roadways to access the parking lot from US 95. Once in the parking lot, you are looking at the back of the building. You have to walk around the building to get inside. When you get to the front of the building, there are two entrances. One is a take out entrance in a room that sells gelatos  and other foods. The second entrance is for dining in.

  The dining room is large, and I feel nicely themed. To the right is a bar with flags of colleges hanging above. Toward the back is a mural of popular pizza families. To the back left is the open kitchen. And to the left is the take out room slash bakery. Throughout the restaurant is sufficient seating.

   Before entering Metro Pizza my mind was decided on ordering the eggplant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. At a cost of around $10, it is worth the money. Especially when it includes french fries. For the most part, I was happy with the hero. I do have a tiny weenie complaint. The hero could of been warmer.

  In general the service was good. Yeah, there was a wait for the food. I expected that on a Friday night. Our waitress was on top of the complimentary dinner roll refills. By the way, I ended up filling up on them. Toward the end of the meal, the waitress probably had a brain fart. This would be one of the strangest moments I experienced dining out. It was material for a Sinfeld episode. When the meal ended, my brother and I ordered coffee. A few minutes later, our waitress returns to the table. She goes up to my brother and says this is the last of the coffee and we are brewing more. I am thinking, ""Excuse me. Am I invisible? Could you have asked if one of us wanted the coffee, or let us know that more coffee was coming on the way?"" Feeling like the ghost of Metro Pizza, I sat there watching my brother sip coffee for what seemed like a good five minutes. When I returned to being a physical being again, the waitress presented me with coffee served in an Izzy cup. I was under the impression that they brewed their own coffee. They serve Izzy coffee. My taste buds regard it as decent. If I had brought it in a coffee shop I would of added a flavored syrup to it. 

  I will return to Metro Pizza. Their egg plant Parmesan hero is a product that keeps me coming back.

You'll see old folks dancing and having a great time, you'll see young and old chicks flashing their titties for drinks. Great bands at 9pm every night and good bartenders.

They have a good list of specialty drink like ""Whiskey Girl"" and ""Pondskipper"" or whatever that are GREAT and they serve them in Mason Jars. They are a bit pricey at $18 but you will only need one. You can get any drink or beer in the Mason Jars. 

They do play nothing but country music. How bad is that really? It's not like it's Hip Hop, still a lot of people won't come here.

The pizza here isn't huge... they are a little bigger than a personal pan pizza at Pizza Hut. Sammy's gives you some healthy options for the crust you can either get wheat crust for a dollar more or gluten free for I think $3.00 dollars more. I opted for the wheat crust because I'm not sure what health benefits gluten free would have on me. I'm not used to making healthy choices but I try...sometimes. I was afraid the crust would be hard and stale but it was very fresh and fluffy inside. My topping for my order was Mozzarella with fresh basil.

The reviews seemed ok and I live close so I thought it would be worth trying even though I have several sushi places I usually am willing to drive to.  This meal was a complete waste of money.  I have had bad sushi before but never where it was spoiled and unable to eat it.  I sent my Amaebi back to the Chef and not only did the staff not find some fresh shrimp to replace it with they didn't even mention it again.  I didn't ask for it to be replaced as I was so turned off from it I don't think I could have eaten it if they did give it to me. Several other types of fish they served was smelly and fishy but just starting to spoil and still edible but not enjoyable.  The rice on the sushi was warm and the fish tasted like it had been unthawed.  I inquired about the rice being so hot and the lady told me the health department makes them do that.  I eat a lot of sushi and nowhere else have I found rice like this.  My daughter had chicken teriyaki and they gave her very little chicken and it was completely dried out and overcooked.  Waitresses seem nice when you sit down then tend ignore you when you want to order more but I could live with that if the food was ok.  Complete waste of time and worst restaurant experience I have had in Vegas in over 20 years of living here.  This place will be out of business soon.  If you can't even eat or slightly enjoy a meal it doesn't even deserve a 0.  My wife enjoyed her desert a lot and said the coconut tempura shrimp was pretty good but thought her sushi was no good.

I love love LOVEEEEEE their banana nut muffins. Every time I go, I always have to get it. I find a entree that comes with banana nut muffin so I can get some banana nut muffin. LOL! Their muffins are really moist which probably means A LOT of butter so if you're on a diet BEWARE. These little devils are delicious!!! I would say not to order the simple dishes. I was trying to eat a little healthier the other day.. so I went with a simple eggs, turkey sausage and asked for hash browns. I love hash browns so I was pretty disappointment in my meal this time. I got two hash browns with two eggs and two turkey sausage patties. First off, the hash browns looked like they were from McDonald's and I wasn't even sure if the turkey sausages were actually made out of turkey. I guess that's the risk you take when you go out to eat though. I expect more from Egg Works I guess you can say. Another sad thing is my friend thought the hash browns at McDonald's were better! Hahah which I thought was a little funny but in a way it made me hate my meal a little more. The work potatoes taste a little hollow too and you can tell they're from the freezer. Each mean is around $10-$15 I would say. If I actually got fresh food, I wouldn't mind paying 10 bucks for it (Just saying). 

They have a bunch of other great options but not for if you're trying to eat healthy and out with your friends. At least I haven't found any I guess. 

I love their stuffed french toast and their waffles with ham and eggs (drools). They have a bunch of other options as well on their cool newspaper menu. 

I say the customer service is amazing because one time we waited for I would say a little over 20 minutes. The waiter for our table gave our party each a free muffin - there were four people at my table. We were pretty happy campers. I mean.. a little after he gave us those muffins, we got our food. I even remember the manger getting me water all the time. I must say that water is really what I use to determine if a place has good customer service because I drink A LOT of water. 

The parking isn't too bad since you can usually go on the other side of 7-11 and park. It gets really packed over the weekend but during the week you can find a spot behind the restaurant.  Also if it is over the weekend expect to wait a good 20 minutes or so.",2014-03-15 15:32:53,0,0,0

My Hubby and I both opted for pizza although some of the other items certainly sounded enticing. 

That was pretty much the extent of our enjoyable experience. My Hubby asked for no onions on his pizza and, yep, he got onions. Lots of red onion. Since our server seemed a bit scattered, my Husband just picked the onions off. I was also hoping for another cocktail but, again, the server seemed oblivious to our table so I just nursed my glass of water. Once we finished eating we waited for the bill and a box for our left overs. And we waited. Not sure why we were waiting so long as it really wasn't busy-- at all. So, needless to say, I got up and asked the hostess for a box & our bill. After boxing up our leftover pizza we waited for the server to finish ringing up our bill so we could sign the copy and head out... and again we waited. The server finally walked by but in a flurry so I had to basically yell at him to get his attention so we could finalize our bill.

The service was phenomenal! 

The food was excellent and the best Asian style food I've ever had. We decided to go with the recommended set price menu, while included two options from the appetizers, two options from the main dishes, a vegetable and a choice of rice. 

Pot stickers: INCREDIBLE. They are crispy and unlike anything I've ever had before. 

Mr. Chows noodles: which the noodles themselves are made in house and if you're lucky you'll see them being made, were delicious. I expected more of a chow mein style noodle but instead received the noodles plain with a sauce overtop. There is an explosion of flavor once the noodles and sauce are mixed. Definitely a favorite!

Green shrimp: which is cooked in spinach and is actually green was so tender that it practically melted in your mouth. 

Beijing chicken: chicken breast that was cut into cubes. It has a soft crunchy on the outside but the meat itself was very tender and full of flavor. It had a light sweetness to it!

Green beans: DELICIOUS. I could have just eaten the green beans and been completely content. They had the right amount of kick to them. 

Raspberry cheesecake: So soft and creamy. Cheesecake with a graham cracker crust and raspberry drizzle. 

Blood oranges: I want to say that they were marinated in bourbon ( I could be wrong)? Either way they were absolutely delicious.",2018-02-02 08:55:45,1,0,0

I ordered salt and pepper fish and the fish was not hot, the salt and pepper pork chops had about 5 pieces on the plate, and the sweet and sour fish had minimal sauce. On top of the food not tasting good, I don't know how 3 sides, rice, and hot tea turned into an $80 bill. FYI a dish in the San Gabriel Valley is under $10 a dish for lunch and under $15 for dinner for simple Chinese food- and, it tastes so much more satisfying that this LV Sam Woo. I mean, I'm glad I tried it so I know never to go back. I would recommend going to a buffet to get Chinese food instead..",2016-01-04 07:14:09,1,0,0

It's very overpriced here compared to other locations. It might be due to the location..but not 100% sure why everything cost almost double compared to other places... They even charge for white steamed rice.

Service here is mediocre. They tend to have a bad attitude and are not very customer oriented.

Other than that: Food is okay. What you would expect from Sam Woo. Roasted BBQ like duck and pork is good. Other stuff is okay. Green onion beef is good. Tofu dishes are generally good as well. The fried chicken wing was meh. It just wasn't seasoned very well.

So the order was placed at 6:50 to be delivered by 8:05. By 8:20 the pizza was not here so I called and they said ""Oh yeah it's out for delivery."" Cool, I can deal with that. 15 minutes later they call me and tell me that our order was caught in a ""shift change"" and was never made. They offered a discount (initially 50%, then $3, and then an email that said $2.09) and a free dessert. After the delivery guy got lost we got the pizza in about 25 minutes. So it arrived looking very undercooked and soggy. They could have kept it in the oven for like 5 more minutes and it would be good. I had a slice and fed my son some and then my husband went for his slice and found a hair embedded in it. Obviously we were both disgusted. My husband was already super fed up and gave them a call and they refused to refund it. They offered a free pizza but neither of us wanted soggy hair pizza.

First off, the menu is really simple. Way too simple. I was thinking because it was so simple, the broth and everything else would be amazing. The broth is okay at best. Better than instant ramen, but not totally better. The noodles, apparently they make it themselves, so I was thinking it would be better. Again, it's not good, but it's not bad. I like noodles at ramen sora or ichi ramen way better. The service was good, but I mean it's really not hard to provide bad service at a ramen restaurant. The place also doesn't have a wait like other ramen places. I can't tell if it's a good thing or a bad thing. Is there no wait because people don't like it that much, or is there no wait because they are new? Anyway, I just tried this spot because I was in the area and ramen sora had a huge wait. I'll probably try it again in a few weeks to see if I have a change of opinion.

We ordered honey walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, house fried rice, wonton soup, noodle soup, roasted pig, and flounder fish. (very typical dishes)

Fried rice and flounder fish was okay. The honey walnut shrimp and Mongolian beef was nothing I've ever tasted before. It tasted very different.

Starting with service, there are a ton of suit dummies walking around this place yet the service was average. Server was friendly but we didn't get good vibes. 
My other problem was with the whole restaurant design. Ugly ass blue carpet in the middle. Looks like they spent a lot on renovating but it looked terribly overpaid for. Felt very tacky. 

Not to mention the fact that as we were escorted to our table the host stepped on and killed a cockroach nearby one of the VIP rooms beside one of their food carts- we should've just left right then but hey, we already paid for the Groupon.

The food was just nothing special at all, very bland. The ribs were ok but needed a lot of their hot sauce, not very tender. Shrimp with walnuts and a yum yum style sauce was heavy and meh. Ginger lobster needed more seasoning to bring out more flavor. Shrimp fried rice was so bland we laughed about how easy it is to make it better at home. Cheesecake was standard.

Overall would not recommend this place to anyone. It's overpriced crappy bland Chinese food. Felt like take out but we were served by tuxedos.

my friend got the cold noodles, which were also really good. it was the first time i had them so i didn't know what they were supposed to taste like, but again, the chewy noodles (this time rice, but still chewy!)! the dish itself was sweet and refreshing, especially after the super spicy hot noodle soup.

we also got a spam masubi to try. it was good and hot and fun to try, but i didn't know what it was and didn't know it was be mostly rice. so i guess if you like hot sushi-type things, it's a good one.

the thing that was weird was their menu. most of the items had english descriptions but a few didn't. i thought maybe these would be the ones that were so authentic and cool that they couldn't be translated. that got me really excited, so i asked the waitress what they were. they turned out to be really normal things like jajangmyeon and stuff. disappointing! it was also hard to communicate with her because she didn't speak english and also probably thought i was crazy for making her translate everything. she was still really nice though.

the service is kind of slow, but i think that was to be expected. i have a soft spot for korean places with diner food (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/bells-diner-ann-arbor) so this really wins my heart.",2013-05-08 20:12:08,1,0,1

This place would be comparable to a Lindo Michocan meal without the expensive price tag. When me and my wife we always seem to order the same thing. 

Salmon Salad 4.5/5- My wife always orders this and she says its one of her favorite salads to eat period. Also she loves their dressings here and she seems to alwasy finish her plate. I like that they cook salmon perfectly because most salmon salads cook the salmon where its too dry.

Chompoton 4.5/5- it is definitely my go to dish its rib Eye steak and with shrimp fajitas also with refried beans rice and salad and big portion of guacamole & go with corn tortillas. I crave eating this.  Its your mexican surf and turf and for a very reasonable price. I love how i can have a bite of steak then shrimp with some grilled onions and peppers with guacamole and smooth out my meal with some beans and rice.  

Appetizers we usually go with.

Empanadas 3.5/5- ooey go cheese filled with ground beef that also comes with guacamole,pico de gallo, and a southwest sauce which is pretty good.

You dont have to order an appetizer if youre on a budget  for you get chips and salsa but you can always add a side of refried beans for dipping and its good as well.

This place is always been a solid choice and because everything is very simple and service is always good. The place always is clean and you can bet that youll get a solid meal without the expensive price.",2015-03-18 23:08:36,4,2,2

It was a rare occasion that I happened to have a Tuesday off, so some friends and I decided to have lunch here. We ordered a large salad and a large pizza, half Honolulu and half Sunspot. They also brought warm bread and butter to the table. It was more than enough food for 3 people. The pizza was good, but sadly it was a little watery and soggy. The Honolulu comes with ham, pineapple, bacon and green pepper, and the Sunspot had chicken, artichoke, tomatoes, basil and garlic. You would think with alllll of those toppings that they would have made the pizza a little bit more well done. Nothing is more unappetizing than a pizza that is watery. I enjoyed the pizza, but it's not the best I have ever had, and the only time I would probably come back here is for happy hour.",2015-05-27 18:58:11,4,5,4

My last trip, I sat outside on the patio. A beautiful 70 degree day in January isn't wasted on me. I came starving and glanced over the menu. My lunch mates were also craving everything, so we settled on a few tapas and a pizza.

We ordered the Chicken Lettuce Cups, Mini Duck Tacos, and Parmesan Crusted Artichokes. The lettuce cups were flavorful and light. I didn't care too much for the duck tacos, but my girlfriend loved them, and she devoured the rest of mine, my favorite was the artichoke. They were deep-fried and came with a yummy sauce. Indulgent and sinful. My favorite of the entire meal. 

The pizza we ordered was the Sun-Dried Tomato (Artisan crust) which was topped with goat cheese, pine nuts, and basil. Me, oh my. This was a very nontraditional pie and the flavors were fresh and bold. The pine nuts added a fun crunch twist, usually reserved for just the crust. I would order this again and again.

Being fatty patties, we ordered the salted caramel pudding which is pretty much sex in glass. ORDER IT! I only state that sternly because it's like crack (addictive) and I need other people to understand/feel my pain.

Sammy is a great bet for those with different dietary needs. The have an assortment of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free goodies. Service is always attentive. It's a quiet, relaxed atmosphere. This particular location has a bar that is open 24/7 and offers the same menu.",2014-01-18 03:31:27,4,3,2

Let's see... This place is pricy, and when we came in my eyes were definitely hungrier than I really was, but I am glad that I didn't follow through with wanting and NEEDING to try everything. 

So we started with the calamari as an appetizer which was fresh and amazing...
Crispy & not to salty.  It wasn't oily at all either & that's ALWAYs good.

Husband's orders first because it will probably be what I'm having this weekend.
He had the Pan Roast which is excellent!  Crab, Shrimp or Combination. Served with Wild Rice and Tomato Butter Sauce.  The sauce is so freaking good it's crazy.  The seafood totally compliments the sauce... 

And now for my boring order:  Fish & Chips... Which is good... But better with the pan roast!  

I really like here & will definitely try other things that will compliment my pan roast. :P

Hmm must be doing something right.  I checked a few reviews and was a little concerned at first, but we made reservations already so I was open to the fact that 47 years of success at 6 other restaurants cant be wrong!  Walked up to the entrance, which was next to Rao's, and was greeted by the down stairs hostess.  I got into the elevator and up up up we went.  When the door opened it was like walking into a different world.  The stank of smoke and bustle of gamblers was gone and we walked into this amazing pristine white room that smelled of these white flowers that were everywhere.  After the hostess greeting we were led to the bar by Victor and he had us giggling all the way down!  The bar is in the back of the restaurant but after seeing the view, I understand why.  Amazing sunset overlooking the Garden of the Gods Pool!  The Bartenders were busy with the cracking and shaking of cocktails for the many dining on the floor.  We sat in the lounge and waited for the rest of our party!  One of the bartenders came out and offered us a menu with drinks and wine, He was from Australia or new Zealand, but we laughed because his name sounded like Britt, Short for brittish lol  He recommended a few cocktails but we had our mind on a bottle with dinner so we got Champagne!  After all this seemed the perfect choice for such a beautiful room!   Victor came back and picked us up with the rest of our party and we were whisked away to our table.  Our Captain, as he introduced himself, was Charles and after the menu presentation I understand why.  He guided us through the selections and we chose the Bejing duck prefix.  While this was going on servers were filling glasses, setting up more Champagne and moving like clockwork.  Big smiles and pleasant mannerisms set the tone for what was to come! Yea we started to feel the champagne a little and then the dishes started coming.  4 starters which were portioned for our party, according the the captain, and lots of food it was.   Squab with lettuce wraps, salt and pepper prawns, Mr Chow spare ribs and Squid ink rice noodles.  this was my doing btw lol everyone had ink in there teeth from the noodles, I took some blackmail pictures that you don't get to see  :)  Squab was amazing with the house made hoisin sauce as was the salt and pepper prawns,,,, Crispy and the seasoning was amazing.   So far our captain has guided us through the waters.  Second course was Sea bass, Velvet chicken, and Spicy pork.  The sea bass was perfect, Light flakey with ginger soy like sauce with Cilantro.  Great combo of flavors as was the spicy pork. Note to self,  should have had the velvet chicken first as it was the lightest of flavors.  Sauteed rice?  it was nice and not like fried rice is usually done. 
Finally the Dish we all waited for,  The Duck!!! Chef came to the table and carved crispy pieces of this amazing duck.  Served with hand made tortillias and duck sauce with some vegetables sticks that was just the perfect way to end the night. We had no room for dessert!  Finishing up our Champagne  Veuve btw! we were off to the a different kind of show.   I must have had 5 or 6 people wishing us a good night on the way out and thanking us for coming.  Nice touch to the night!  Thank you Mr Chow for making a fun memorable night 47 years in the making!  

Pictures to come when we get home.  No ink teeth though as those are for the kids  :)",2016-01-30 20:21:09,0,0,0
